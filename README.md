# k600analyser for PR170

This is an 2011 experiment: Characterization of cluster states in 16O with the (p,t) reactino.
It is the pre-cursor for PR226. We did not see a lot of 16O states, partly because it is not
so easy to have a nice 18O target.

But there is still interesting data to be extracted.

The experiment made use of 2 W1 DSSSD's. Previously the data analysis was performed with a amalgamation
of the standard K600 MIDAS singles analyser and SIMSORT.

Here we attempt to enable data-analysis with the new modern analyser.
